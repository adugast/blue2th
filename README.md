## Introduction:

Blue2th is a bluetooth proxy API on top of libbluetooth.

## Requirements:

libbluetooth must be available on your system:
```
sudo apt install -y libbluetooth-dev
```

## Setting up blue2th example:

Clone the project to retrieve the sources:
```
$>git clone https://github.com/adugast/blue2th.git
```

Go in the build directory of blue2th:
```
$>cd blue2th/build/
```

Build the project using CMake (from the build directory):
```
$>cmake ..
```

Finally, use make to compile the sources and so generate the binary (still from the build directory):
```
$>make
```

## Example Usage:

The blue2th example as been created to demonstrate the usage of the API

Launch blue2th:
```
$>./blue2th
```

## Output:

/!\ XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX represents bluetooth 48-bit device address
/!\ xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx represents bluetooth user friendly string name

```
First local bluetooth controller:[hci0][XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX]
4 bluetooth device has been found.
[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX][xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX][xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX][xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
[XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX][xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]
